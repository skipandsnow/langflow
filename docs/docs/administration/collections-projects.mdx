# Collections and Projects

My Collection is a space in Langflow where users can manage, organize, and access their flows and components.
Flows and components are displayed as individual cards that provide relevant information.

/>

* **Folders**: Users can organize their projects into folders. Default folders include "My Projects" and the ability to create new folders. Hover over a folder to access options to download or delete it.

* **Search Bar** Enables users to quickly search through their flows and components.

* **Select All**: This feature allows users to select all projects displayed on the page for batch actions like moving, deleting, or exporting.

Click on a flow card to open it in Langflow Workspace or use the **Playground Button** for direct access to execute and interact with the flow’s chatbot interface.

## Collections

Components created or imported by the user are also displayed in **My Collection** and can be directly removed from here.

A collection is a snapshot of flows available in a database.

Collections can be downloaded to local storage and uploaded for future use.

## Project

A **Project** can be a flow or a component. To view your saved projects, select **My Collection**.

Your **Projects** are displayed.

Click the **![Playground icon](/logos/botmessage.svg) Playground** button to run a flow from the **My Collection** screen.

In the top left corner of the screen are options for **Download Collection**, **Upload Collection**, and **New Project**.

Select **Download Collection** to save your project to your local machine. This downloads all flows and components as a `.json` file.

Select **Upload Collection** to upload a flow or component `.json` file from your local machine.

Select **New Project** to create a new project. In addition to a blank workspace, [starter projects](../starter-projects/basic-prompting) are also available.

## Project options menu

To see options for your project, in the upper left corner of the workspace, select the dropdown menu.

  }}
  style={{ width: "30%", margin: "20px auto" }}
/>

* **New** - Start a new project.

* **Duplicate** - Duplicate the current flow as a new project.

* **Settings** - Modify the project's **Name** or **Description**.

* **Import** - Upload a flow `.json` file from your local machine.

* **Export** - Download your current project to your local machine as a `.json` file.

* **Undo** or **Redo** - Undo or redo your last action.

## Project folders

Multiple projects can be stored in **folders**.

Folders allow you to categorize flows and components into manageable groups. This makes it easier to find and access specific projects quickly.

**My Projects** is a default folder where all new projects and components are initially stored unless specified otherwise. Users can create custom folders to better organize their work according to specific needs.

Hovering over a folder in Langflow provides options to either remove or download the entire folder, allowing you to keep an offline copy or migrate projects between environments

Create new folders with the **New folder** button. One folder can store multiple projects (as the default My Projects folder does).

You can download folders of projects as a single JSON file, and upload files and flows to your folder.

Click the **Trash** icon to delete a folder.
