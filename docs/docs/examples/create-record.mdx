# Create Data

In Langflow, a `Data` has a structure very similar to a Python dictionary. It is a key-value pair data structure.

The **Create Data** component allows you to dynamically create a `Data` from a specified number of inputs. You can add as many key-value pairs as you want (as long as it is less than 15 ðŸ˜…). Once you've chosen the number of `Data`, add keys and fill up values, or pass on values from other components to the component using the input handles.
